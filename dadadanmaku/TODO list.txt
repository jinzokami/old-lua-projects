in order of priority

add a simple enemy(moves forward and nothing else)
add collision detection and response(quadtrees will be VERY useful here)
collision will be based on distances(every collider will be a cricle)
start work on the moving background
start work on the gui
start work on assets
brainstorm powerups
figure out how enemy spawning will work(maybe have timers that spawn enemies just outside of the level)
work on the sounds of the game
