make a game like survival kids.
pokemon style movement(locked to a grid but smooth movement)
harvest sticks and rocks to make tools
use tools to hunt animals(random encounters)
use tools to chop down trees break large rocks and cut vines (for better versions of those tools)
equipment system weapon armor (durability on both)
hunting and fight is turn based(or not if i still can't figure it out)
hunger
thirst
a goal
an ending
saving and loading

not necessary but try
random worlds
tiled maps


limitations
screen size is 160x144 (gameboy resolution)
buttons are analogous to gameboy buttons(a, b, select, start, d-pad)
use state machines(make smooth movement by using a moving state that the player exits once they've arrived at their destination)
include a moveTo(destination, rate) function that moves the object smoothly towards a target point

function GameObject:moveTo(destination, rate) -- returns the movement vector args: destination vector, amount to move
	local arrived = false
	local posDelta = self.position - destination
	--we now have a vector that tells us how far we have to go and in what direction
	
	local finalDelta = posDelta:getNormalized()
	
	finalDelta = finalDelta * rate

	if finalDelta.x > posDelta.x then
		finalDelta.x = posDelta.x
	end

	if finalDelta.y > posDelta.y then
		finalDelta.y = posDelta.y
	end

	if (finalDelta.x == posDelta.x) and (finalDelta.y == posDelta.y) then
		arrived = true
	end

	return finalDelta.x, finalDelta.y, arrived -- returns the dx and dy and whether it has arrived at destination.
end
